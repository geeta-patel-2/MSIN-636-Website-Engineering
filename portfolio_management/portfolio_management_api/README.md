# üìà Portfolio Management API

This is a Node.js and Express-based backend API for managing investment portfolios, accounts, user associations, and proposed trade sessions. It serves as the backend for a portfolio management application that enables users (including advisors and individuals) to track and manage assets, propose trades, and monitor holdings in real-time.
